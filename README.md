Hi littile bit of a Context here: Time series prediction is the process of using historical data to forecast future values. Unlike regular machine learning where data points are independent, time series data is a sequence of observations recorded over time, meaning each data point is dependent on the previous ones. The goal is to identify patterns and trends in the past to make educated predictions about the future.
if you are familiar with trading, time series prediction is the underlying statistical and machine learning method that can be applied to make the forecasts needed for a swing trading strategy

Buy and Hold-> no stocks hold their values till 2009-2023

The blue line, labeled "Ensemble Strategy," shows a significant profit. Its cumulative return is consistently positive, often reaching very high levels, particularly with those large upward spikes.

Analogy for Simplicity :

Imagine you bet on a race.

Buy and Hold (orange line)  : You picked a horse at the start and just hope it wins. If the horse trips and falls (market goes down), you lose.

Ensemble Strategy (blue line) : You're predicting if the horse will gain or lose ground on each lap.

If you predict the horse will fall behind on the next lap, and it does, you bet against it (go short) and you win money, even though the horse itself is doing badly.

The horse's performance (Buy and Hold) is bad, but our betting strategy based on predictions (Ensemble) is good because we correctly bet against it.

This is precisely why we see the blue line rising while the orange line is falling in many parts of the graph â€“ the ensemble strategy is successfully at making money from negative market movements by going short. note- no stocks hold their values till 2009-2023 

Scenario 2: When Buy and Hold Gets Better (Orange Goes Up), Prediction (Ensemble) Goes Down
This can also happen and is a sign of a prediction error by the ensemble model.

What Buy and Hold (Orange) Does: If the actual market price of the asset is rising on a particular day, then the Buy and Hold strategy naturally gains money for that day.

What Ensemble Strategy (Blue) Does When It Makes a Mistake:

Let's say the market is going to rise tomorrow.

Your Ensemble Model incorrectly predicts that the log return for tomorrow will be negative (or predicts a very small positive when a large one occurs, and doesn't capture it efficiently).

Based on this incorrect prediction, the Ensemble Strategy might decide to "go short" (betting on a decline) or not go long aggressively enough.

When the market does rise, the Buy and Hold strategy gains money, but your Ensemble Strategy loses money because it was positioned incorrectly for the actual market movement.
